Inspired by [Uses This](https://usesthis.com/), the tools, services, and techniques I'm using to get things done & [Manas' version.](https://manassaloi.com/usesthis/) Also, I'm still on the [YourStack](https://yourstack.com/) waitlist so till that time; have this.

Update: Got access to YourStack (Beta); will be updating this soon. Excited! :)

Software
--------

#### On Laptop

-   Google Chrome: My primary browser. Interesting fact: I do not use [AdblockPlus.](https://adblockplus.org/)
-   [GSuite](https://workspace.google.com/) & [Microsoft Office Suite](https://www.office.com/): Well...
-   [Slack](https://slack.com/intl/en-in/): For Office Communication.
-   [Zoom](https://zoom.us/): Best Video Conferencing tool out there. Airblack runs on Zoom.
-   [Roam Research:](https://roamresearch.com/) I use the Web App, this is my primary dump for any stream of consciousness (happens a lot more than you may think).
-   [Webflow:](http://webflow.com/) Built this on Webflow!
-   [Notion:](https://www.notion.so/) Company Documentation lives on Notion & I spend a lot of my time here. This is a strong clue as to what I do in general. :D 

#### On Phone

-   [Streaks](https://streaksapp.com/): To build new habits & track them.
-   [Breaker:](https://www.breaker.audio/) To listen to podcasts; love the social aspect. I follow [@Sar Haribhakti](https://twitter.com/sarthakgh) on there for new finds.
-   InkPad Notepad: Primary note taking app on my Phone. I live my live through it.
-   [Apple Books](https://www.apple.com/in/apple-books/): The favourite bit has to be the syncing. Have read dozens of ebooks on my phone thanks to this app.
-   [Insight Timer - Free Meditation App](https://insighttimer.com/): I prefer this free app over paying for Headspace now.
-   [Apple Music](https://www.apple.com/in/music/): Started listening to music on an iPod and have never quit. I also subscribed to Spotify since it launched in India until recently.

Hardware
--------

-   [MacBook Pro (15-inch, 2018)](https://www.apple.com/in/mac/compare/): Work computer provided by [Airblack](https://www.apple.com/in/mac/compare/)
-   [Apple Mouse:](https://www.apple.com/in/shop/product/MLA02ZM/A/magic-mouse-2-silver) Mouse provided by Airblack. I am spoilt and don't use track-pads whenever I work on a table.
-   MacBook Air (13-inch, 2013): Girlfriend's old laptop that I use as my personal computer.
-   iPhone 8 Plus: My latest and hopefully last iPhone adventure. Phones have lost the novelty factor for me.
-   [Sennheiser HD-450 BT](https://www.amazon.in/Sennheiser-HD-4-50-BT-Cancellation/dp/B01MSZSL4I): A vanity purchase I live with. Good noise cancelling headphones in 10-15K INR price range.
-   [Kindle Voyage (Wi-fi model):](https://www.amazon.in/Kindle-Voyage-Wifi-High-Resolution-Built/dp/B00IOY5AS6) I got this as a gift in 2017. It is probably my most prized possession.
-   [Yamaha Y310:](https://in.yamaha.com/en/products/musical_instruments/guitars_basses/ac_guitars/f_fx/index.html) Guitar of 4 years; my mental sanity depends on this.
-   [Casio CTK-551](http://arch.casio-intl.com/asia-mea/en/emi/past/standard/ctk551.html): Synth of 19 years; this is what a BFF means. Although I rarely play anymore, yet am very fond of it.
-   Rubik's Cube: This is my fidget spinner; plus I practice a couple of rudimentary algos.
